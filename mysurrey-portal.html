				<h3>MySurrey Portal is a digital service platform that aims to serve the City of Surrey (located in British Columbia, Canada) citizens by acting as a digital front counter. As a User Experience Designer, I helped translate the vision of a one-stop shop digital government from a physical service delivery to online.</h3>

				<h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
				<h3>This project began with the problem of an ever growing list of city’s online services, which led to difficulty in way finding the service a citizen need.</h3>
			</div>
			<!-- Objective End -->

			<!-- Process Start -->
			<div class="process">
				<p>I was brought in to first run through a series analysis and identify issues of user flows and user needs. This included gathering and understanding transactional data, as well as conducting heuristic evaluations on existing webpages and the interface of existing services. Comparisons were done to inform upper management about user pain points.</p>

				<div class="image-caption">
					<h3>Too much text that does not speak to citizen’s natural language</h3>
					<h3>No consistency and standards to cue citizens on their tasks</h3>
					<h3>It is not efficient to use due to lack of hierarchy in content and actions on task</h3>
				</div>

				<img src="./img/surrey7.jpg" alt="old business licence online service heuristic evaluation"/>

				<p>Afterwards, a colleague and I discovered that there are many types of transactional services that are all compacted into a single page with not sense of filter or tailor to accommodate the large range of particular customers. Therefore customers often get overwhelmed online and would rather complete their transaction through other channels (such as by phone or in-person).</p>

				<img src="./img/surrey11.jpg" alt="mysurrey portal wireframes"/>
				<img src="./img/surrey12.jpg" alt="mysurrel portal user flow"/>

				<p>Once informations were gathered, organized, communicated and agreed upon, the design team had better knowledge about our target audience. I then began making wireframes and interactions to demonstrate potential ideas of a portal platform to meet user needs. After iterations, mockups were created for development.</p>

				<p>To make this product happen, I work with diverse team members including User Experience Designers, Graphic Designers, Communication Strategists, Quality Assurance, Developers, Business Analysts, Security, and other stakeholders to ensure smooth deliverables.</p>
				<p>The portal has now been released as beta for a year, but the design cycle has just begun. More services are been added and redesigned, where improvements are happening constantly. To do so, I facilitated workshops to enhance interactive data gathering sessions, as well as conducted user research to better understand our stakeholders’ business and user needs. MySurrey Portal currently acts under a guest version, while a Single Sign On component would be added shortly.</p>
